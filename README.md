# Packaging Genie (by RAMA)

Packaging Genie is a browser-based pallet and container loading optimiser. You choose a pallet or container, the products and the mix you want, and the application finds the closest combination of **whole cartons** that physically fits, checks weight and height, and shows **exactly where every carton goes**.

- **One self-contained file:** `index.html`. There's nothing to install and no server, database or API keys. It works offline in Chrome and Edge.
- **Load units:**
  - Pallets: Europe, Industrial, US GMA, Asia, Australia and India standards, and any you add.
  - Containers: 20′ GP, 40′ GP, 40′ HC and 45′ HC, with loose cartons or loaded pallets.
- **Calculation modes:**
  - Single SKU
  - Target Mix (percentage by cartons, saleable units or weight)
  - Exact Quantity
  - Multi-Pallet allocation
  - Pallets → Container
- **3D view of every load:** rotate, zoom, preset views, build it up layer by layer, play the loading sequence, and hover over a carton for its details. Arrows on the carton sides show which way up each carton is.
- **Traffic-light status on every plan:**
  - GREEN = ready to load.
  - AMBER = load with care, or safe but room to improve.
  - RED = not safe as planned, or safe but space is wasted.

  Stability, space used, target mix, weight and height are each checked, with plain-language advice. You can change the thresholds in the Self-Test & Method tab.
- **What else fits?** Suggests extra cartons of your mix SKUs, then other active products, plus a combined best fill, to bring the load closer to 100%. Every suggestion is re-planned and physically validated. “Add to plan” creates an Adjusted plan with its own layout and status.
- **Product Master brands:** Phoenix Gravity, RAMA or C Line. SKU dropdowns are grouped by brand, and “Add all active SKUs of <brand>” fills the mix table with one brand.
- **Light and dark mode:** the app follows your system setting by default, and the header button switches it. Drawings keep a light background so prints look the same in both modes.
- **Every result is physically validated.** The app checks footprint, overlap, height, weight, orientation rules, 100% base support and carton counts, then draws the layout from the real carton coordinates.

## Use it

**Option A – GitHub Pages (recommended for the team)**

1. Create a **public** repository on GitHub, e.g. `packaging-genie`.
2. Push this folder to the repository's `main` branch:
   ```bash
   git init -b main
   git add .
   git commit -m "Packaging Genie v1.1"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-account>/packaging-genie.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
3. On GitHub, go to **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source** and choose **GitHub Actions**.
4. The workflow `.github/workflows/pages.yml` runs the automated tests and then publishes the app at `https://<your-account>.github.io/packaging-genie/`.

Only `index.html` is published. If a test fails, the site isn't updated.

**Option B – local file.** Download `index.html` and double-click it.

## Sharing data across the team

Product, pallet and container masters and saved plans are stored in each person's browser (`localStorage`). To share them, click **Export data (JSON)**, send the file to your colleagues, and have them click **Import data**.

## How the optimiser works (short)

1. **2-D patterns.** A recursive guillotine search over "normal" positions finds the best layer for each carton. It tries both footprint rotations, mixed-orientation rows and leftover strips, and never relies on `FLOOR(L/l) × FLOOR(W/w)` alone.
2. **Physical packing engine.** This answers "can these exact cartons be placed?" It has two methods, and every placed carton has real X/Y/Z coordinates:
   - **Full layers.** A layer is as tall as its tallest carton. Nothing is ever placed in the air gap above a shorter carton, and upper layers may only stand on carton tops at exactly the layer height.
   - **Column blocks.** The footprint is cut into strips and each strip into blocks. A block holds one SKU, or a nested chain of up to three SKUs where each upper carton fits inside the footprint of the carton below (e.g. P17 on P24, Carbon Filters on POSTreat). A dynamic programme over SKU subsets finds the arrangement. Containers are loaded strip by strip from the closed end.
3. **Mix optimiser.** This answers "which whole-carton combination best meets the target?" It combines four searches: target-following growth, a utilisation fill-up, proportional scaling with largest-remainder rounding, and a local search that adds, removes and swaps cartons. The physical packing engine checks every candidate. Weight, volume and dominance pruning keep the browser responsive, and the search runs in a Web Worker with progress and a Cancel button.
4. **Scenario ranking.** Each objective uses:

   `score = capacity utilisation % − λ × weighted deviation − μ × weighted deviation beyond tolerance + 0.01 × cartons`

   Weighted deviation = Σ priority weight × |achieved % − target %|. The priority weights are High 3, Normal 1 and Low 0.5.

   | Scenario | λ | μ |
   |---|---|---|
   | Closest Target Match | 4 | 20 |
   | Balanced | 1 | 5 |
   | Maximum Utilisation | 0.15 | 0.5 |

   All weights are configurable in `CONFIG` at the top of the engine script.

## Performance, memory and hosting (audited for v1.2)

**Calculation time** (Node.js on a typical office PC; browsers are similar):

| Load | Time |
|---|---|
| Single SKU, pallet | about 0.1 s |
| Target mix, 4–6 SKUs, pallet | 0.06–0.3 s |
| Target mix, 6–10 SKUs, 40′ HC container | 0.4–1.0 s |
| 17,700 tiny cartons in a 40′ HC | 0.3 s |
| 40,000 tiny cartons, 4-SKU mix, 40′ HC | 1.2 s |
| Multi-container plan, 6,000 cartons | 1.0 s |
| Extreme shipment: 60 SKUs × 60 cartons (55 pallets) | about 6 s, with progress and Cancel |

Calculations run in a background Web Worker, so the page never freezes, and a Cancel button stops long runs.

**Browser behaviour:**
- **3D view:** hidden inner faces are skipped. Rotating a 17,700-carton container takes 22–33 ms per frame.
- **Side elevation:** draws only the visible cartons.
- **Memory:** the page uses about 5–35 MB, and stays flat across repeated calculations.

**Browser storage** (localStorage, about 5 MB per browser):

| Record | Size | Rough capacity |
|---|---|---|
| Product | about 0.3 KB | about 1,000 products = 0.3 MB |
| Saved pallet plan (3 scenarios with layouts) | about 30 KB | about 160 plans |
| Saved container plan | about 180 KB | about 28 plans |

Saved Plans shows how much storage is used. A layout larger than 1 MB is saved as inputs only and recalculated when loaded.

**GitHub hosting:**
- **Repository:** about 0.35 MB.
- **Site:** `index.html` is 323 KB, or 96 KB compressed, which is what each page load transfers.
- **GitHub Pages limits:** 1 GB per site and about 100 GB of bandwidth per month.
- **Example:** a team of 50 opening the app 20 times a day uses about 2 GB per month, or 2% of the limit.
- **Other costs:** no server, database or paid storage is needed, and a CI run takes about 1 minute of free Actions time.

## Security and data safety

- **Imported data files are untrusted.** Every product, pallet and container is rebuilt from known fields with the right data types and validated. Saved plans from a file keep only their inputs, and the layout is recalculated from your own data when you load them.
- **Text is escaped.** Everything you type (SKUs, names, plan names) is escaped before it is shown.
- **CSV export is safe.** Cells that start with `=`, `+`, `-` or `@` are neutralised, so they can’t run as spreadsheet formulas.
- **Storage problems are reported.** If browser storage is full, the app shows an error and never shows a false “Saved.”.

## Assumptions (v1)

- **Dimensions** are outer carton dimensions. Values entered in cm are converted to mm.
- **Height:** maximum height includes the pallet base, so usable height = maximum − base height.
- **Clearance** applies between cartons. An upper carton never bridges the clearance gap between two lower cartons: it must rest fully on real carton tops.
- **Overhang** is off by default. When allowed, it applies up to the chosen number of mm per side. Upper cartons still need full support.
- **Fragile** cartons never carry other cartons.
- **Maximum stack layers** limits how many cartons of that SKU are stacked in one column or layer sequence.
- **Maximum stack weight** is stored for a future version.
- **Container figures** are typical ISO internal sizes and payloads. Confirm them with your carrier, because road weight limits may be lower.
- **Target % of locked SKUs:** when a SKU's quantity is locked, the target % of the other SKUs applies to the optimised (unlocked) part of the load.

## Tests

```bash
node tests/run-tests.mjs
```

This runs the built-in self-tests: every default SKU on the Europe and Industrial pallets, mixed tests A–E, exact quantity, multi-pallet, containers, validation messages and locked quantities. The same tests can be run from the **Self-Test & Method** tab in the app.

```bash
node tests/fuzz-tests.mjs 150
```

This runs randomised stress cases, including “Add to plan” re-plans. A separate geometry checker, which doesn't use the engine's own validator, re-checks bounds, overlap, support (by point sampling), weight, counts and the recalculated percentages.

## Project layout

```
